üîç Project Concept
A free web platform where shop owners, restaurant managers, and individuals can post leftover or surplus food.
People in need can reserve items online and pick them up locally.

Inspired by Too Good To Go, but 100% non-profit.

üåü Key Features
User and merchant registration

Food donation listings (with photo, expiration date, quantity)

Geolocation-based product discovery

Reservation system with real-time availability

Notifications for nearby offers

Statistics: amount of food saved

Feedback & review system

üß± Database Structure
users: personal info, role (merchant or individual)

products: food items listed (name, photo, expiry, location)

reservations: user, product, and pickup time

reviews: ratings and feedback from users

notifications: alerts about nearby listings

üß© Challenges and Considerations
Food Safety: Ensuring quality of donated items

Fraud Prevention: Avoiding misuse or abuse of the system

Perception: Maintaining the image of a solidarity-based, non-profit platform

üí° Selected MVP Summary
A minimal yet impactful version of the platform with:

Core functions only (registration, posting, geolocation, reservation)

Free access for both users and merchants

No ads or donations in MVP to preserve the 100% solidarity focus

Why This MVP?
Simplicity: Easy to build and test

Social Impact: Immediate help for people in need

Environmental Impact: Reduces local food waste

Merchant Benefit: Positive brand image and community involvement

ü§ù Collaboration Plans (Future Phases)
1. Charitable partnerships

Planned for Phase 2

2. Funding Options
Advertising: Rejected for MVP to maintain non-profit values

Crowdfunding / Donations: Unreliable for early-stage funding

May be considered post-launch

üß† Development Process
Idea brainstorming and validation

MVP feature definition

Database and architecture design

Documentation for future onboarding

Currently in solo development, looking to expand the team

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies to Use and Implementation
Frontend (User Interface)
HTML5 / CSS3: Structure and styling

JavaScript (Vanilla or framework): Dynamic behaviors

React.js (recommended):
‚û§ Fast and modular, great for building reusable UI components

Backend (Server and Logic)
Python (Flask or Django):
‚û§ Flask: Lightweight, perfect for MVP
‚û§ Django: All-in-one framework with built-in user system and admin panel

REST API: Clean communication between frontend and backend

Database
SQLite (local testing) or PostgreSQL (production)

Tables: users, products, reservations, reviews, notifications

üìç Next Steps
Develop core MVP features

Test locally with small group of users

Expand to partnerships and new features in Phase 2
